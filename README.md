# Top 3 Taco Shops

## Application Purpose
Top 3 is a taco shop locator that spots out the top three taco shops in Austin, Texas and allows users to view these three taco shops and their popular offerings, followed by voting for their favorite taco from that respective shop, and viewing the map below that shows the exact map location of their favorite taco shop.

## Application Demonstration
When users visit the Top 3 website, they are introducted to a major header showing the official website logo, a phrase indicating its purpose ("Taco Shops in Austin"), its slogan ("Any day is a good day for a taco!") which brings significance for the current weather forecast indicator right next to it. The weather forecast includes an icon highlighting the current weather in Austin followed by its temperature in farenheit degrees. This was developed with the use of the OpenWeather One Call API which fetches current weather forecasts from any city in the world.

Following the main header, the user is introduced to three distinctive cards of information. These three cards display the top three taco shops in Austin, Texas, respectively Torchy's Tacos, Taco Deli, and Veracruz All Natural, which are highlighted by three significant details. First is the title of the taco shop and a fact about the shop, followed with the address of their first shop location and a phone number to call that location. The significant aspect is the Top Picks category, which allows users to see the top five tacos to try at that particular shop. When the user hovers their mouse over the name of a particular taco (say Trailer Park from Torchy's Tacos), a toolpick appears showing the user the ingredients of that taco (which for the Trailer Park taco consists of fried chicken, green chiles, lettuce, pico de gallo and cheddar jack cheese with poblano sauce on a flour tortilla. They also have the option to get it "trashy" which removes the lettuce and adds queso.). From there, users are able to look over the popular tacos offered at the top three taco places in Austin, Texas. 

Once they are done looking over the three cards of information of the taco places, the user will then view a dropdown poll asking them to choose their favorite taco. Based on the Top Picks from each of the three places, there are fifteen tacos displayed on the poll. Users will be able to select one taco from the dropdown function and the selected taco is then saved into the user's local storage of their browser. The saved taco will remain in the local storage unless the user finds themself another favorite taco to select on the dropdown function. 

After viewing the dropdown content, the user is able to see the map highlighting the three taco shop locations in Austin, which are shown on the map with a fork and knife icon. This map content was developed with the Mapbox API that allows developers to fetch and establish particular locations to be present for the user to see, which in this case is the Top 3 Taco Shops. The footer is then presented and concludes the overall content of the application.

## Application Developed With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* Materialize - CSS Framework that provides modern responsive web design and was used to establish the modern design for the website. 
* Mapbox GL JS - client-side JavaScript library used for building maps and adding user interactivity and customization. Mapbox was used to create the map element for the website and added exact location data of the taco shops.
* OpenWeather - One Call API: This API was used to collect the information that directly pulls the current weather forecast for a specific city, which is Austin, Texas for this application. With AJAX, it pulls information of the URL and with jQuery, appended the information to its own div content to display the weather forecast with the current temperature and an appended image source highlighting the current weather status.
* jQuery & jQuery UI - jQuery was implemented in this application in numerous ways. It allowed its use to function with both the OpenWeather and Mapbox APIs to allow the map to display its coordinates of the taco shop location and display the current weather forecast for Austin, Texas. 

## Developer work committed

## Further Development and Future Notes
<!-- here we can be able to demonstrate personal concerns with failed implements of website, what we can include for future versions of the website and what would fit with tacos -->     
* Mickey: Margarita/alcohol/beed locator
Additional card highlighting whether the taco shop offers alcohol at their specific location. 
Torchy‚Äôs, Tacodeli serves alcohol/beer; Veracruz does not.

* Kevin: Dark mode
Add a button to toggle between light and dark mode. 
We will also add code to let the user‚Äôs operating system do that lifting for us by saving the user‚Äôs selection so that it will be applied consistently throughout the site and on subsequent visits. To do that, we can save the user‚Äôs choice to the localStorage when the theme is toggled using Pure CSS or JavaScript.
