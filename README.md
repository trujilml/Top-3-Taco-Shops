# TOP 3 - Taco Shop Locator for Austin, Texas

## Application Purpose
TOP 3 is a taco shop locator that spots out the top three taco shops in Austin, Texas and allows users to view these three taco shops and their popular offerings, followed by voting for their favorite taco from that respective shop, and viewing the map below that shows the exact map location of their favorite taco shop.

The weather forecast includes an icon highlighting the current weather in Austin followed by its temperature in farenheit degrees.

These three cards display the top three taco shops in Austin, Texas, respectively Torchy's Tacos, Taco Deli, and Veracruz All Natural, which are highlighted by three major aspects. First,
